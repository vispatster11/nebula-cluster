# Pipeline Summary

This file consolidates the repository's pipeline fixes and current status.

## What was fixed

- Deprecated actions updated (upload-artifact, CodeQL SARIF uploader).
- Trivy scan configured to report results without failing the run.
- Helm lint workflow pinned to a reproducible Helm version.
- Integration tests made more resilient (k3d handled gracefully).
- NetworkPolicy template corrected so Helm template rendering includes it.
- Bandit and pip-audit now scan all Python projects in the repo.

## Current status

- Workflows updated and pushed to `main` branch. Monitor at:
  https://github.com/vishal-patel-git/nebula-cluster/actions
- The repository contains a comprehensive integration workflow that runs unit and integration tests, as well as Helm deployment checks.

## How to run quick local verification

Run the local verification script to validate the pipeline fixes (no timing data included):

```bash
bash tests/integration-local.sh
bash verify-pipeline-fixes.sh
```

## Notes

- Credentials are auto-generated by the Helm chart unless you explicitly set them via Helm values.
- Images should be pinned (example tags like `0.1.0` are used in chart examples).
